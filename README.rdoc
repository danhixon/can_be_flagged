Flag This
=================

Allows for flags to be added to multiple and different models.

== Resources

Install

* To install as a gem (recommended):
** gem install flag_this or
** Just add "gem 'flag_this'" to your Gemfile and "bundle install"
 
Generate your flag model:

** Rails 3: rails g flag

Then migrate your database:

rake db:migrate

== Usage
 
 * Mark your ActiveRecord model can_be_flagged.
 
 class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
 	can_be_flagged
 end
 
 * Add a flag to a model instance
 
 flaggable = Post.create(:text => "Don't be offended by this.")
 flaggable.flags.create(:comment => "I am offended by that!")

 * I like to add a counter cache column to my flaggable types:

 add_column :posts, :flags_count, :integer

 class Flag < ActiveRecord::Base
   belongs_to :flaggable, :polymorphic=>true, :counter_cache=>true
 end

 * You can also add a callback
   
 class Article
   can_be_flagged
   def after_flagged
     # send an email
     # delete this post
     # suspend the owner of the post if the flags.size > 3
     # suspend the owner of the post if their total flags.count > 5
   end
 end
