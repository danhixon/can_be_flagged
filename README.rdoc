== Can Be Flagged

Allows for flags to be added to multiple and different models.

== Resources

Install

* To install as a gem (recommended):
** gem install can_be_flagged or
** Just add "gem 'can_be_flagged'" to your Gemfile and "bundle install"
 
Generate your flag model:

** Rails 3: rails g flags

Then migrate your database:

** rake db:migrate

== Usage
 
 * Mark your ActiveRecord model can_be_flagged.
 
 class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
 	can_be_flagged
 end
 
 * Add a flag to a model instance
 
 flaggable = Post.create(:text => "Don't be offended by this.")
 flaggable.flags.create(:comment => "I am offended by that!")

 * I like to add a counter cache column to my flaggable types:

 add_column :posts, :flags_count, :integer

 class Flag < ActiveRecord::Base
   belongs_to :flaggable, :polymorphic=>true, :counter_cache=>true
 end

 * You can have different types of flags

 class Article
   can_be_flagged :offensive, :spam
 end
 
 * This gives you methods like this:
 @article.offensive_flags.create(:comment => "gross!")
 @article.spam_flags.create(:comment => "Don't sell your pharmaceuticals on this site!")
 Aricle.find_spam_flags_for(@article)

 * You can also add a callback
   
 class Article
   can_be_flagged :after_add => :flagged

   def flagged
     # send an email
     # maybe delete this article if there are too many flags
   end

 end
 
 * In fact you can pass any options that are accepted by has_many:
 
 class Article
   can_be_flagged :dependent=>:nullify
 end
